# Solar-System-Simulation
Solar system simulation with pygame of the inner solar system with moons and the asteroid belt behind Mars
the original idea came from , and i added the moons and the asteroids belt, the moons don't rotate 
because of gravity (unlike the plants about the sun), because i found really difficult to position the moon so close so it
captured by earth's gravity and at the same time be visible, so i just make them massless and follow them (later i will fix it)..
